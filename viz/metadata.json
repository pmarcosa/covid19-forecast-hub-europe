        "methods_long": "Fraunhofer-ITWM's predictions are based on a cohort model that groups people according to four age groups and according to the status infected, detected and successfully vaccinated. The dynamics of the epidemic are described by integral equations. In particular, we assume an infectious period with fixed onset, end and infectivity. The most important parameters are contact rates between age groups, detection rates and times, and death rates and times. They are adjusted to the historical data of the RKI. For forecasts, the simulation is continued with the parameters determined for the last week. In principle, the forecast quality could still be improved by anticipating the effects of events such as the end of public holidays on contact and detection rates. However, this is not yet done in the automatic submissions. All calculations use automatic differentiation. This speeds up parameter adjustment and allows for error estimates. The latter are determined by comparing counted and simulated cases and by matching the empirical standard deviations with the standard deviations predicted by the calculated sensitivities. The model is described in detail in https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/de/presse-publikationen/presseinformationen/2021/2021-06-22_Dritte_Welle_Starker-Effekt-von-Schnelltests-an-Schulen.html"

For an initial, unobserved, seeding time infections were estimated using an exponential model with priors based on observed growth. For each subsequent time step, previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate of Rt to give the incidence at that time. The infection trajectories were then mapped to mean reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain incubation period and report delay distribution. Observed reported case counts were then assumed to be generated from a negative binomial observation model with overdispersion, multiplied by a day of the week effect with an independent parameter for each day of the week. Temporal variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process with a Matern 3/2 kernel. Rt was assumed to be constant over the forecast horizon although a correction was applied to adjust for the time-varying proportion of the population that was susceptible. Deaths were then modelled as a convolution of forecast cases combined with some scaling factor, a day of the week effect and a negative binomial observation model.",

Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the  trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily confirmed cases will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the case fatality fraction that best fits the historical observations."

We then estimate parameters by a knowledge synthesis process considering parameter ranges derived from external studies and public data.

Our model can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 30s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated by our evaluation and benchmarking page at https://scc-usc.github.io/covid19-forecast-bench Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions."

        "methods_long": "This is a model based on a mechanistic compartmental approach, where some parameters are taken from literature, some parameters are estimated from an anonymized dataset of confirmed subjects. It estimates moving ascertainment rate using data of hospitalized subjects (using a proportion of cases not caught before admission to hospital), so it estimates not only the observed part of the epidemic (compartment I) but also the undetected absent infected (compartment A). The model incorporates transmission rate estimate dependence on mobility data and immunization after vaccination and optimizes affected clusters' size to estimate all exposed individuals using the moving ascertainment rate estimate. To model deaths, we incorporated fixed time delay from positivity report to death estimated from data. Currently, we assume around 0.44% IFR, a simple division of the age structure 0-20/20-65/65+ is used. The model estimates continuously from the first outbreak (spring 2020), the prevalence corresponds to the Czech prevalence study from May 2020 as well as to December community test screenings. We incorporated dominance of alpha variant at the beginning of the year 2021 by multiplying the transmission rate by 1.5 (the estimate is based on data that reveal evidence on its dependence on the number of risk contacts - study PAQ research https://zivotbehempandemie.cz/kontakty or mobility data). With the dominance of alpha variant we increased the probability of hospitalization by factor 1.3 and the conditional probability of death in case of hospitalization by factor 1.1. There is a significant decline of death rate of 65+ cohort in hospitals from the second half of March. We started to adjust its value to estimated 0.36% daily decrease based on fit to data of hospitalized positive subjects (starting form submission 2021-05-10). Thanks to time series of vaccinated we could compare two different estimates of the probability of hospitalization and we deduced that we underestimated the prob. of hospitalization and overestimated the size of the affected clusters, and that 1/100 (starting from 2021-03-15) now seems more appropriate than 1/160 (starting from submission 2021-06-07). We incorporated dominance of delta variant. We assume the transmisibility of the delta varinant is 1.4 times higher than the alpha variant (submissions 2021-07-12, 2021-07-19). Starting from submission 2021-07-26 we work again without incresed transmissibility of the delta variant. We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths and cases while the prediction intervals are estimated using time series decomposition. Especially, we subtract a deterministic trend given by the SEIAR model."

For each jurisdiction, our model runs 4 million simulations to find the best R value that would allow the SEIR model to fit the data for confirmed cases. Our model assumes that the R value changes quite rapidly over time due to changes in human behavior. Our model uses a sliding window to fit the data and find the best R values for each of the windows."
